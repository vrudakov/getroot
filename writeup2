## First we need to find the IP address of the VM

* Refer to writeup1

## Connect to laurie : /home/laurie/ (same as in first writeup)

```330b845f32185747e4f8ca15d40ca59796035c89ea809fb5d30f4da83ecf45a4```

* We can now connect with ssh as "laurie".


## Race Condition Privilege Escalation
* YES!!!! we are on the serveur ! know we need to get information about the os
* kernel verions : ```uname -r``` => 3.2.0-91-generic-pae
* Distrubition name and verisons ```cat /etc/*-release``` => Ubuntu, 12.04

* After having information on what we where working on we did some research on [EXPLOIT DATABASE](https://www.exploit-db.com)
* We find the "Linux Kernel 2.6.22 < 3.9 - 'Dirty COW' 'PTRACE_POKEDATA' Race Condition Privilege Escalation (/etc/passwd Method)"
* go to https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839/ and Copy the script
* ```gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt && ./dirty```
* add a password, example: 12345
* ```su firefart``` use your password
